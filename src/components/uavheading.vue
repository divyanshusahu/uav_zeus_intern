						The software is based on peer reviewed research papers published on the sizing of UAV
						using a statistical approach. The software is used to find the approximate weight of
						battery, maximum take-off weight, wing span etc.
						for the given payload and range required. The software takes input from the user and
						we urge the user to be careful while giving the input. The software is not made in
						standard SI units as users are more familiar with KM for range than meters. Please
						be careful while inputting data.
